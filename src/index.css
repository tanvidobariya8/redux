/* In the context of programming and web development,
"Redux" typically refers to Redux,
a popular state management library for JavaScript applications,
especially those built with frameworks like React. When you use Redux,
you create a "store" that holds the application's state. The store is managed by Redux and 
follows certain rules for updating the state. To update the state, you dispatch "actions" to the store.
 An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in the application, such as user interactions 
 or API responses.

In Redux,
the core function that handles state updates is called a "reducer." A reducer is a pure function 
that takes the current state and an action as input and returns the new state based on the action. 
The reducer should not modify the current state but instead return a new state object. */
